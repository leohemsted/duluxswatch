# duluxswatch - dulux colour discovery/sharing is hard on mobile

https://duluxswatch.herokuapp.com

The dulux website is a bit slow, and doesn't load information in a helpful order - from my computer,
after 2.14 seconds, the only things left to load on the 
[colour tester page](https://www.dulux.co.uk/en/products/colour-tester#?selectedColor=1187442) are the
name and the colour.

So why not make a web page that only contains the name and colour to begin with! It's also nice and reactive and web friendly and your entire screen is the colour!

Of course it's hosted on free heroku so if it's not been used in a while it'll take just as long but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

this product isn't affiliated with dulux, and in no way do i guarantee accuracy.
